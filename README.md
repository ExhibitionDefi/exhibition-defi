- **Softcap Protection:**
  - If a project fails to reach its surprises or delays.
  - The smart contract enforces the vesting schedule for full transparency and fairness.
- **Withdrawal of Unsold Tokens:**
  - For projects that fail to meet the softcap, creators can withdraw the unsold tokens after contributors have been refunded, ensuring no tokens are stuck in the contract.
